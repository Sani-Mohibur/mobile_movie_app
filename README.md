## Key Features

* **Infinite Scrolling:** Movies are loaded dynamically on the Home screen as the user scrolls to the bottom.
* **Debounced Search:** Search queries are delayed by 500ms to prevent excessive API calls, improving efficiency.
* **Adaptive Theming:** Supports both Dark and Light mode, controlled via the toggle switch on the Settings page, and respects system preferences.

## Future Development Roadmap

These features are planned to take the application to a production-ready stage:

* **Local Data Persistence:** Implement **AsyncStorage** or **MMKV** to store user-specific favorites, making the 'Saved' page fully functional across sessions.
* **Skeleton Loading Screens:** Replace simple loading spinners with cinematic skeleton components to improve the user's perception of speed.
* **Advanced State Management:** Refactor global state using a library like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** for cleaner data flow.
